This file is different that the ones on [KopiJS/branding](https://github.com/KopiJS/branding). Some similar shapes are merged together to create a single `path` element, for optimization purposes. Special manual optimizations are done to make sure the file is as small as possible.

These files are used to generate the `favicon.ico`. 32x32 is like the retina version.
